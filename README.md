# microscopic_images

Here is my first DS project.

A friend of mine is doing a research with microscopic injuries and its recovery time. The data are photographs of cell slices with the injuries and they have a special treatment with a drugfor healing.

The cell slices are photographed and the injuries are the black dots. The objective is to count the black dots and to performe some geometric measurement of it: perimeter, area, major and minor axis and compare the evolution of it in time.
