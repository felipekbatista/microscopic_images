# microscopic_images

Here is my first DS project.

A friend of mine is doing a research with microscopic injuries and its recovery time. The data are photographs of cell slices with the injuries and they have a special treatment with a drugfor healing. The first objective is to count the injuries (black dots) and to performe some geometric measurement of it: perimeter, area, major and minor axis and compare the evolution of it in time. 

At first he was doing it manually with ImageJ, but I decided to help him with it, so the goal is to automate this image counting process for the images with the use of ML
