v1.1
  image pre-processing for improoving feature extraction
    tests with different histograme qualization methods for improoving th eimage quality;
   Pre-processing will not be used here, although the various histogram equalizations have shown as a good feature for adding in the img db
    

v1.0 
  image processing
    filter banks with features and variations
      gauss filter with different sigma,
      prewitt, scharr, sobel, roberts, canny
      gabor with multiple kernels
  ML model 
    A RFC with n_estiamtors = 10;
    To train the model, it was used 4 images previously segmented;
    For evaluation of the features withing the model, a feature importance distribution histogram was plotted;
 Test
    3 images were used for testing;
    the result showed a segmentation, but it had some salt grains sprayed all over the image
