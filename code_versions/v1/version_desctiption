v1.3
  Following the results of v1.2.1, some 3 new images will be used as templates for improving the model. 
  The images that will be used are the ones that were used for tests in previous version. The new templates are uploaded in templates folder.

v1.2
  New features for the bank. Use original image and gaussian filter for the bank
  v1.2.0
    use of the folowing features: original image and multiple gaussian features
  v1.2.1
    use only of original image as the feature, in grayscale
  v1.2.2
    use only the gaussian  filter as the feature
   
   The image results from v1.2 showed an improvement, although some difference between each version was still visible. 
   So far the results in v1.2 with less salt grains were in v1.2.1 (check in image folder). 
   comparison between versions v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2.1 showerd again v1.2.1 had less salt grains spread across the image, together with a more uniform image result.

v1.1
  image pre-processing for improoving feature extraction
    tests with different histograme qualization methods for improoving th eimage quality;
  Pre-processing will not be used here, although the various histogram equalizations have shown as a good feature for adding in the img db
    white gridlines showed up in all images, I could not figure out how to solve it

v1.0 
  image processing
    filter banks with features and variations
      gauss filter with different sigma,
      prewitt, scharr, sobel, roberts, canny
      gabor with multiple kernels
  ML model 
    A RFC with n_estiamtors = 10;
    To train the model, it was used 4 images previously segmented;
    For evaluation of the features withing the model, a feature importance distribution histogram was plotted;
 Test
    3 images were used for testing;
    the result showed a segmentation, but it had some salt grains sprayed all over the image
